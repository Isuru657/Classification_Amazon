This project conducted by Kelly, Jiyoung and I will contribute towards our final grade for our COSC074 class. This project will use a linear classifier to predict if an Amazon product is considered awesome or not based on its rating. We will be using NLP methods for feature extraction and using Python's scikit learn to construct our model and to predict using it.
